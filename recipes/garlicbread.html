    <h2>How to make it</h2>

    <P>Below is the tried-and-true approach to making lasagna. It may take a lot of time and effort, but it's worth it!</P>

    <h3>The ingredients</h3>
    <P>Technically, this recipe is quite customisable, and that's part of its appeal. You can change some ingredients, but most lasagna contains the following:</P>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat: </strong>sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef in this case</li>
            <li><strong>Onion and Garlic: </strong>known to provide <em>tons </em> of flavour</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato products: </strong>a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>adds a subtle sweetness to enhance the sauce</li>
            <li><strong>Herbs and Spices: </strong>this lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles: </strong>literally in the name, can be storebought or homemade</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>Mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese, as well as ricotta, are not uncommon choices</li>
            <li><strong>Egg: </strong>helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Cooking procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make some meat sauce</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles, usually by boiling in salted water</li>
        <li>Make a ricotta mixture</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna in the order shown in the next section</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake, removing the foil halfway through</li>
        <li>Let it rest a moment before serving</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Layering the lasagna</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
