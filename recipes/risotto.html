    <h2>What is risotto?</h2>

    <P>Risotto is a rice dish originating from Italy. Starchy rice is simmered in broth until it reaches a creamy consistency.</P>
    <p>Most risotto contains these ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>White wine</li>
        <li>Onion, sometimes garlic</li>
        <li>Paremsan cheese</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are plenty of delicious add-ins when it comes to risotto. Most of the time, a meat product is preferred, but the earthy flavours of mushrooms are certainly welcome.</p>

    <h1>How to make mushroom risotto</h1>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <P>To make a mushroom risotto, you'll want the following:</P>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Homemade or store-bought chicken stock can work here. Ideally use low-sodium stock. Also, the stock will be kept hot throughout cooking, so add a bit more than the recipe suggests to account for evaporation, and consider
                adding scraps from preparing the risotto ingredients to amp up the flavour. Vegetable stock also works if you're trying to make this vegetarian.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rice: </strong>Getting the creaminess typically associated with risotto requires a short-grain rice with plenty of starch, such as Arborio.</li>
            <li><strong>Shallots: </strong>A finely chopped yellow onion can be used if shallots are unavailable.</li>
            <li><strong>Mushrooms: </strong>Almost any edible mushroom works here. But whatever you do, <strong>WASH YOUR MUSHROOMS. </strong>They're dirty, and full of water that needs to be evaporated away anyways.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil: </strong>Used to saute the shallots and mushrooms. Extra virgin is fine as this recipe does not involve very high temperatures.</li>
            <li><strong>White wine: </strong>A crisp, dry white wine like pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc adds an essential layer of flavour. Technically optional, but you'd be missing out on some flavour if you omit the wine.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Add it near the end of cooking for extra creaminess and flavour.</li>
            <li><strong>Paremsan Cheese: </strong>Only Parmesan cheese. Don't ruin the dish by picking anything else.</li>
            <li><strong>Chives: </strong>Cuts through the richness and adds visual appeal.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients used:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
        <li>1.5 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>Half of a cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
        <li>Third of a cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm broth over low heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately - the risotto's still cooking itself from the residual heat.</li>
    </ol>
